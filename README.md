# Graph neural network modeling of time-dependent materials under indentation

This repository contains codes for training temporal graph neural network models for elasticity problems.

> **Notice**: scripts include **placeholders** (input data). To run this repo, paths have to be adapted and input data provided.
## Scripts:

- **`main.py`**: training and validation;
- **`main_kendall.py`**: training variant that uses Kendall-style learned loss weights;
- **`models.py`**: model definitions;
- **`utils.py`**: normalization helpers.
